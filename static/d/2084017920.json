(e.g. shortest path first -> branch and bound). The order in which you apply different algorithms to the problem is sometimes referred to the meta-heuristic strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Exhaustive algorithms</h3>\n<p>Exhaustive algorithms will always find the best possible solution by evaluating every possible path. These algorithms are typically significantly more expensive then the heuristic algorithms discussed next. The exhaustive algorithms implemented so far include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Random Paths</li>\n<li>Depth First Search (Brute Force)</li>\n<li>Branch and Bound (Cost)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Heuristic algorithms</h3>\n<p>Heuristic algorithms attempt to find a good approximation of the optimal path within a more <em>reasonable</em> amount of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Construction</strong> - Build a path (e.g. shortest path)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortest Path</li>\n<li>Arbitrary Insertion</li>\n<li>Furthest Insertion</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Improvement</strong> - Attempt to take an existing constructed path and improve on it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2-Opt Inversion</li>\n<li>2-Opt Reciprcal Exchange</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dependencies</h2>\n<p>These are the main tools used to build this site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">gatsbyjs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org\">reactjs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API\">web workers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://material-ui.com/\">material-ui</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://deck.gl/#/\">deck.gl</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/\">mapbox</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contributing</h2>\n<p>Pull requests are always welcome!
