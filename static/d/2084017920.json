These algorithms are typically significantly more expensive then the heuristic algorithms discussed next. The exhaustive algorithms implemented so far include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Random Paths</li>\n<li>Depth First Search (Brute Force)</li>\n<li>Branch and Bound (Cost)</li>\n<li>Branch and Bound (Cost, crossings)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Heuristic</h4>\n<p>Heuristic algorithms attempt to find a good approximation of the optimal path within a more <i>reasonable</i> amount of time.
